# Exploring_Hacker_News_Posts

## About Project
*Hacker News* is a site started by the startup incubator **[Y Combinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/)**, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon and it is extremely popular in technology and startup circles.

In this project, we will analyze the posts made by users at the website about questions asked (`Ask HN`), responses on the thread (in terms of comments) and details about projects, products (`Show HN`) or just general interesting topics.
